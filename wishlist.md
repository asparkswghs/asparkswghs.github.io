# Austen's Wishlist- 2022

--------

 **Before You Read What's Below:** I'm planning on going on my school's trip to Europe (England and France) in spring of 2024. This may seem like a long ways off, but I need your help now! Direct donation link may be coming soon, but don't count on it. 

--------

Below are some items that I've been wanting, in case you can't think of anything.

You don't *have* to choose something directly from this list, you can use it for inspiration. If you do get something from this list however, make sure to **let my parents know before you buy so that there aren't any duplicates**.

This page is mainly just for inspiration on the kinds of things I like, as I've only included super high quality things that I really like.


If you don't see anything you like, **gift cards are cool-- especially from [this list](/pages/giftcards)**
