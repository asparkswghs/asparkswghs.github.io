# Austen's Wishlist- 2022

Below are some items that I've been wanting, in case you can't think of anything.

You don't *have* to choose something directly from this list, you can use it for inspiration. If you do get something from this list however, make sure to **let my parents know before you buy so that there aren't any duplicates**.

If you don't see anything you like, gift cards are cool- especially from [this list](/pages/giftcards)
