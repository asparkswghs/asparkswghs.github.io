# Austen's Wishlist - 2023

--------

##  **Before You Read What's Below:** I plan to go on my school trip to Europe (England and France) in the spring of 2024. This may seem far off, but I need your help now! [Donate Here](https://my.passports.com/students/pay?s=20241172&d=2007-05-18)

Below are some items that I've been wanting, in case you can't think of anything.

This page is mostly a personal list of things I'm saving up for. However, it *can* be used as inspiration for things to get me.

If you don't see anything you like, **gift cards are cool-- especially from [this list](/pages/giftcards)**
