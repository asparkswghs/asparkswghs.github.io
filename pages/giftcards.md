# Gift Cards

It's honestly kinda hard to find a gift for someone. Thankfully, gift cards exist. A heartfelt note with a gift they are SURE to like (because they pick it themselves).
Here's a list of stores I'd like giftcards from, in order from greatest to least.

1. Steam
    ------
    Steam is a store for PC games, that I can now play thanks to y'all helping me get a gaming PC for my 15th birthday.

    You can [get a digital one online](https://store.steampowered.com/digitalgiftcards/), or pick one up and mail it. You can get them at most stores in the US; namely BestBuy, Target, and GameStop.

1. LTT Store (.com)
    ------
    LTTstore.com is a merch store for a youtuber I like, Linus Tech Tips, and they support digital gift cards. 

    You can pick one up [on their store](https://www.lttstore.com/products/giftcard).

1. Amazon
    ------
    There are a lot of nifty things on Amazon, even though it's a large company who already has plenty of money.

    You can find them on [amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) by searching "gift card" in the box at the top.
