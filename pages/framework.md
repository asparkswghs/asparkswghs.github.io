# Framework Laptop

My current laptop is a 2012 Macbook pro, which I chose because of it's upgradeability, build quality, and low price on the used market. However, it's beginning to show it's age. 

There is another laptop manufacturer who promises good build quality, upgradeability, and repairbility-- Framework. You can read more about their mission [here](https://frame.work/about). 

Another cool thing is the pricing. By assembling the laptop yourself (which is fairly straightforward) and without the added price of a Windows installation (I'll be installing [Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org/) instead) the device becomes much cheaper.

### What I'd choose

The [DIY Edition](https://frame.work/products/laptop-diy-12-gen-intel/) starts at $819.00, with an Intel i5-1240P processor. I'd also add the 500GB WD Black SN750 NVMe SSD, and 8GB of DDR4-3200 Memory and a USB-C Power Adapter to charge it with. The laptop also has modules for the ports, so that you can choose what ports you want. I'd choose one USB-C (for charging), one HDMI (for external displays), and two USB-A ports (for thumb drives and all the other things that use USB-A). 

This brings the total to $1,028.00

But, after saving up for awhile, it will be possible. If you want to help, birthday money is appreciated.
