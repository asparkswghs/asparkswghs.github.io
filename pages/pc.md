# For my birthday this year, all I want is to purchase and build my own PC.
I've been interested in PCs for awhile now, watching [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXuqSBlHAE6Xw-yeJA0Tunw) and learning how to build a custom PC to the best of my ability, and how to pick the right parts ([especially from this LTT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BL4DCEp7blY)). 

Note: **please do not purchase these parts for me**, I would like to do the purchasing and most of the parts are too expensive for any one person to gift in full. You can contact my parents about how to donate, or mail a card to **312 Atalanta Ave, Webster Groves MO, 63119**.
## Parts
There are several components necessary for building a PC, and the complete list is [here](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/2X9yKp) on PC Part Picker.
Here, I've broken down what each part does in a short, simple descripton for those of you who'd like to know and maybe arent as educated as I am in the PC space, and then a short paragraph about why I've chosen that product in particular.
Please note that this list **is not final** and may change depending on how much I can scrape together for this computer.
### CPU - [AMD Ryzen 5700G](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/ycGbt6/amd-ryzen-7-5700g-38-ghz-8-core-processor-100-100000263box)
The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the brains of the operation, it makes all of the calculations necessary to run the system ([you can learn more here](https://youtu.be/uoJKwTkN-6c)).

![CPU](https://cdna.pcpartpicker.com/static/forever/images/product/f599944d7bed683e57062447764ce9d9.1600.jpg)

I've chosen this CPU because it's a good balance between price and performance. It has 8 cores and is clocked at 3.8 GHz. At the time of writing it's going for about $260 US on Amazon. (click on the link in the header for a breakdown of all merchants currently selling it, as you can for all the components on this list)
### GPU
The GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is what makes graphical output, or what you see on your screen. It renders images and text and sends it out in a way your monitor can display.

The GPU I've chosen is an iGPU or *Integrated GPU* which means it's built into the CPU I've chosen above, which cuts costs in [the current Silicon Shortage.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020-present_global_chip_shortage).
### Motherboard - [Gigabyte B550M DS3H AC](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/RHWzK8/gigabyte-b550m-ds3h-ac-micro-atx-am4-motherboard-b550m-ds3h-ac)
The Motherboard is the a PCB (printed circuit board) that all of the other components plug into. It allows everything to comminicate with eachother and provides the ports to plug in keyboard, mouse, headphones, and any other peripherals. It also takes in power from the Power Supply and sends it to the CPU and RAM.

![Motherboard](https://cdna.pcpartpicker.com/static/forever/images/product/f297e0c6c4d4721c02cf4d51f53674aa.1600.jpg)

I've chosen this motherboard because it has built-in WiFi, and has all the connectivity that I need. It's also in a smaller form factor (micro-ATX) so I can put it in a smaller case that takes up less space.
### RAM - [Team T-FORCE DARK Za 16 GB (2 x 8 GB)](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/2Byqqs/team-t-force-dark-za-16-gb-2-x-8-gb-ddr4-3600-memory-tdzad416g3600hc18jdc01)
The RAM (for Random Access Memory, sometimes just "Memory") is where all the information the CPU is working with is stored so it can be accessed quickly.

The RAM I've chosen is a set of two 8GB modules (for a total of 16 Gigabytes) and is reasonably fast while not being too expensive.
### Storage - [Crucial MX500](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/ft8j4D/crucial-mx500-500gb-25-solid-state-drive-ct500mx500ssd1)
The Storage Drive (I'll be using an *SSD* or *Solid State Drive*) is where all of the data in a computer is stored. 

![SSD](https://cdna.pcpartpicker.com/static/forever/images/product/d9cccb47a1d6da491f3c6e74ad51e80b.256p.jpg)

The SSD I've chosen has 500GB worth of storage and reasonably fast. Crucial is also a fairly reputable brand in the PC building community.
### Case - [Fractal Design Meshify C Mini](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/JsKcCJ/fractal-design-meshify-c-mini-dark-tg-microatx-mini-tower-case-fd-ca-mesh-c-mini-bko-tgd)
The case or chassis is what houses all of the components, and filters out dust while allowing fans to blow air thru, keeping the components cool. It has places to mount all the components to keep them safe and organized.

![Case](https://cdna.pcpartpicker.com/static/forever/images/product/a77c3dc3732a3bd8f2d559cf7c03fb82.1600.jpg)

I chose the *Fractal Design Meshify C Mini* because of it's small(er) form factor that will fit better on my desk, it's superior build quality, and many other features. It looks awesome, while having excelent airflow and dust filtration. It also comes with 2 case fans preinstalled, so I wont have to buy any extras for now. [This review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDisNT7pXiA) goes more in-depth, but is of the larger, tower case. While I could've gotten a cheaper case, I would just end up upgrading it later I think it's better in the long term to shell out a little more for the case, as this is the component that will last the longest.
### Power Supply - [Cooler Master MasterWatt 650 W](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/VGc48d/cooler-master-masterwatt-650w-80-bronze-certified-semi-modular-atx-power-supply-mpx-6501-amaab-us)
The Power Supply has an obvious function: convert the power from the wall into all the different voltages and amounts that the different components of the system need. 

This power supply in particular is 650 Watt, so It'll withstand many upgrades and more powerful. It is also semi-modular, so the extra cables that I don't need can be unplugged from it and not take up extra space within the case (which helps with cable management) while not being as expensive as a fully-modular powersupply. It also has an *80+ Bronze* rating for efficiency and quality.
### Monitor - [Sceptre C248B-114RN 24.0"](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/MqL48d/sceptre-c248b-144rn-240-1920x1080-144-hz-monitor-c248b-144rn)
The monitor is the screen that you use with your PC.

![Monitor](https://cdna.pcpartpicker.com/static/forever/images/product/36a744ed1f39724ccfebf62f5643787f.1600.jpg)

This Monitor is a respectable resolution (the resolution is how many pixels it has) at 1920x1080. It also has a 144 Hz refresh rate (how quickly the monitor can change what it's showing) which this PC build won't be able to utilize entirely, but will be great for upgrades in the future.
### Peripherals
I already have a Mouse and Keyboard that I use with my current desktop setup (a 2010 iMac). I also have a great set of Desktop speakers, and a set of high-quality headphones for listening to music and playing [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft)
### Operating System
This is the software that runs on you computer and allows for you to run and use applications

First of all, I have strong opinions against Microsoft Windows, and wil be opting for [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) because of so many reasons, It'd take an hour just to read them. I'm going with the [Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org/) distribution because it's incredibly stable, while still being very up-to-date.
## Summary
I think this is a pretty decent build for my budget, and I'm fairly confident about building it. This PC is at around $850 at the time of writing, and though prices do fluctuate, it should stay around that price. I'm lucky to have so many people who care for me, and want to give me something I'll really enjoy for my fifteenth birthday this year. Thanks for being there for me thus far.

Regards,

Austen Sparks

## Questions
# Why build your own PC? Isn't it easier to just buy one from a store?
While it is *easier* to buy a PC from a store, there are much better reasons to build your own PC:
- Custom-built PCs tend to be more upgradeable, and easier to swap newer parts into as computing needs change
- While building a PC you get to learn more about how it functions
- Parts available for custom-built PCs tend to be higher quality (especially the Motherboard and Power Supply)
- A custom built PC is custom. It's tailored to my specific needs and use case.
And, above all, I can look over at my PC and proudly say **"I built that."**
# Why a desktop PC? Why not just get a good laptop that's more portable?
Well, all of the "Heavy-duty" computing (and playing video games) that I have to do can be done at my desk at home. Laptops are also restricted by their size, this causes many issues:
- they are (generally) much more expensive than desktop computers
- they run hotter than desktop computers (shortening the components's lifespans)
- laptops are extemely less upgradeable (except for the AMAZING [Framework laptop](https://frame.work/), but I'm going to use my current laptop until it gives up first)
# What is Linux? and why do you prefer it over Microsoft Windows?
Linux Linux (/ˈlɪnʊks/ LIN-uuks) is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux))

Being open-source means I can view the underlying code, and the the whole community contributes to it, rather than a select team in a corporation whose entire goal is to make a profit. It also provides for the four software freedoms:
1. The Freedom to Use for any purpose
2. The Freedom to Modify in any way
3. The Freedom to Distribute Modifications
4. The Freedom to Study the software and it's code
This also means that I have complete control over my computer, without any secret [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates) sauce mixed in.
